# Todo List App

The Todo List App is a simple React application that allows users to manage a list of tasks. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed or incomplete by clicking on them, and delete tasks from the list. The application uses Reactâ€™s useState hook to manage the list of tasks and their completion status, and it provides visual feedback by styling completed tasks with a line-through effect. The app features a responsive design with a clean and user-friendly interface.
